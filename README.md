# Detection of Folier-Disease in Apple Leaves

A model to predict if a apple leave is healthy or not based on images of the leaves using VGG-16 architecture implemented using the keras API.
The dataset used was from a **Kaggle Competition** you can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-pathology-2020-fgvc7/overview).
The dataset could also be found in the `images` folder of the repository.
`images\OriginalDataset` contains the original kaggle dataset. I have split the dataset into train and test folders.
The train folder is further classified based on the plant disease the image represents.

Check the `requirments.txt` file for the libraries used and the versions.
Feel free to connect for any explanations or suggestions on improving the model.
